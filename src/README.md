Absolutely ✅ — a **README.md** will make the project easier to understand, share, and extend.
Here’s a good first version tailored to your **Rust Mafia Simulator**:

# 🏙️ Gang Simulator in Rust

A text-based **multiplayer gang simulator** written in Rust.
Players (or AI-controlled mobs) form gangs, recruit members, make alliances, steal gold, attack rivals, and conquer cities.

The world evolves turn by turn, creating **strategic and dynamic mafia-like interactions**.

---

## 🚀 Features

* **Mobs (Gangs):**
  Each mob has:

  * A **Boss** 👑 with power
  * **Members** 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 with skills
  * **Cities** 🏙️ with guards
  * **Wealth** 💰 (gold coins)
  * **Allies** 🤝 and **Enemies** 😡

* **Actions:**

  * Recruit members
  * Attack rival mobs
  * Steal gold from rich enemies
  * Conquer cities
  * Form alliances or mark enemies for revenge

* **Strategic Targeting:**

  * Avoid attacking poor mobs (not worth it)
  * Prefer stealing from wealthy mobs
  * Respect alliances (until betrayal 👀)
  * Revenge against mobs who wronged you

* **Turn-based World:**

  * Each turn, mobs decide actions
  * World updates dynamically
  * Final standings show wealth, cities, and alliances

## 🎮 Example Gameplay Output

```
--- Turn 1 ---
Rusty Blades attacks Bug Lords!
Rusty Blades wins!
Rusty Blades successfully stole 100 gold from Null Pointers!
Bug Lords now considers Rusty Blades an enemy!

--- Turn 2 ---
Null Pointers attacks Rusty Blades!
Null Pointers defends successfully!

Final Standings:
Mob { name: "Rusty Blades", wealth: 600, cities: [("Rustville", 5), ("Bugtown", 8)], allies: ["Bug Lords"], enemies: ["Null Pointers"] }
Mob { name: "Bug Lords", wealth: 200, cities: [], allies: ["Rusty Blades"], enemies: ["Rusty Blades"] }
Mob { name: "Null Pointers", wealth: 650, cities: [("Pointer City", 5)], allies: [], enemies: ["Rusty Blades"] }
```

## 🔮 Next Steps (Planned Features)

* [ ] Diplomacy phase (alliances can break, betrayals possible)
* [ ] Revenge mechanics (enemies prioritized for attacks)
* [ ] Victory conditions (last mob standing OR wealth threshold)
* [ ] Player vs AI (human controls one mob, others AI-driven)
* [ ] Save/load system for persistent worlds
